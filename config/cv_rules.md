# CV Writing Rules

Important note: consider those information that was collected about the target company: their values, philosophy and intentions (and, if it's clear, expectations from the candidates). Consider it when you generate any text in CV. Make sure that, at least, what you are gonna to add to CV doesn't contradict to company's view of the world and expectations from the candidate. Where possible (it's hard, obviosly) try to generate a text that alligns with the company mindset. 

These rules MUST be followed when generating CV content.

Use SequentialThinking MCP for analysing data and developing CV text and formattring. Prioritize quality over speed.

## Recommended Practices (Based on Proven CV Patterns)

### Action Verbs — Start Every Bullet Point With
Use strong, specific verbs that demonstrate ownership:
- **Engineer** — "Engineer integrated vulnerability management system..."
- **Develop** — "Develop AI-driven tools to examine codebases..."
- **Architect** — "Architect and deploy enterprise-wide security pipeline..."
- **Conduct** — "Conduct internal application penetration testing..."
- **Perform** — "Perform security design reviews..."
- **Define** — "Defined and documented secure architecture principles..."
- **Automate** — "Automated and maintained security controls..."
- **Strengthen** — "Strengthened security of Kubernetes clusters..."
- **Deploy** — "Deployed and configured security products..."
- **Create** — "Created automation scripts for repeatable installation..."
- **Manage** — "Managed SIEM platform with focus on alert optimization..."
- **Design** — "Designed and executed security awareness program..."
- **Investigate** — "Investigated security alerts through log analysis..."
or other with similar direction and meaning.

### Skill Grouping — Organize by Logical Categories
Group skills with descriptive context. Some examples.
- **Security Architecture & Design** — Defense-in-depth, zero-trust, threat modeling, risk assessment
- **Application Security** — SSDLC, SCA, SAST, DAST, specific tools used
- **Vulnerability Management** — Identification, triage, remediation workflows, tools
- **Automation & Development** — Languages with proficiency level, IaC tools, CI/CD
- **Cloud & Containers Security** — Specific platforms, security tools, controls
- **Infrastructure & Detection** — SIEM, IDS, hardening, monitoring tools

List all skills and core technologies that have even passive relationship to the role.

### Employment Entry Format
Consistent structure for each role:
```
Dates       | Title, Company                    | Location
            | - bullet 1
            | - bullet 2
            | - bullet 3
```

### Certification Format
Year and full name:
```
2022 | CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)
2020 | OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)
```

### Experience Summary Pattern
When profile summary is included, use third-person perspective:
> Security engineer with 11 years of experience across IT infrastructure, DevSecOps, and application security. Specializes in security architecture and design, translating threat landscapes into practical controls. OSCP certified with hands-on penetration testing experience.

Style: bright and creative. Do not use common phrases. Specify exact areas of knowledge and professional growth which shows the most relevant match with target position.

## Prohibited Practices

### Do Not Include Objective Statement or Summary Unless It Adds Unique Value
These are often skipped by reviewers; the space is better used for achievements. Only include a profile/summary if it:
- Highlights years of experience
- Specifies core specialization
- Mentions notable credentials (OSCP, CISSP)

### Do Not Use Subjective Self-Assessments
Phrases like these are unverifiable noise:
- ❌ "Excellent communicator"
- ❌ "Passionate team player"
- ❌ "Hard worker"
- ❌ "Self-motivated"
- ❌ "Detail-oriented"
- ❌ "Results-driven professional"

### Do Not Include Outdated or Irrelevant Technologies into summary text or last 5 years of experience
Listing obsolete tech raises questions about currency. Avoid prominently featuring:
- Skills irrelevant to the target role
- Legacy systems unless specifically relevant

### Do Not Use Dense Walls of Text or Paragraphs
Bullet points should be scannable:
- Maximum 1-2 lines per point. 3 acceptable only when the bullet text is about something that really can be explained shorter and, at the same time, bullet brings explicit value for degree of candidate match to target position. 1 line is approximatelly 12-13 words.
- Break complex achievements into multiple bullets
- Use parallel structure across bullets

### Do Not Include Personal Information Beyond Contact Details
These can introduce bias and are not expected:
- ❌ Photo
- ❌ Age or date of birth
- ❌ Marital status
- ❌ Nationality (unless work authorization is relevant)
- ❌ Religion
- ❌ Hobbies (unless directly relevant)

### Do Not Use Generic, Overused Phrases
These dilute ownership — be specific about your role:
- ❌ "Worked on..."
- ❌ "Helped with..."
- ❌ "Participated in..."
- ❌ "Responsible for..."
- ❌ "Duties included..."
- ❌ "Involved in..."
- ❌ "Assisted with..."

**Replace with specific actions:**
- ✓ "Engineered..." (not "worked on")
- ✓ "Led..." (not "helped with")
- ✓ "Owned..." (not "participated in")
- ✓ "Delivered..." (not "responsible for")

## Formatting Requirements

### Dates
- Format: `Mon YYYY — Mon YYYY` or `Mon YYYY — Present`
- Use em-dash (—) not hyphen (-)

### Locations
- Format: `Country`

### Length
- Target: 2 pages maximum
- Junior roles (<5 years): 1 page
- Senior roles (5-15 years): 1-2 pages
- Executive roles: 2 pages maximum

This applies to PDF-rendered CV with A4 format. 

### Bullets Per Position
- 3-6 bullets per role
- More bullets for recent/relevant positions
- Fewer bullets for older positions
