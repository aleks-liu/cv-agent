Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Security Software Engineer, Detection Platform Infrastructure position at Anthropic. My background is in security engineering with a focus on building monitoring infrastructure and detection systems.

At Vkontakte, I built security monitoring from the ground up: deployed log collection agents (winlogbeat, sysmon, osquery) across the enterprise, configured SIEM platforms (Splunk, Humio) with Logstash pipelines, and developed correlation queries that transformed high-volume raw telemetry into actionable alerts. This work required understanding both the security domain and the data engineering challenges of processing logs at scale.

More recently at Unlimit, I have been building security platforms: an integrated vulnerability management system with Python automation, and AI-driven tools that analyze codebases for security issues and automate triage of scanner findings. I am already applying AI to security problems and want to do this at a larger scale.

The Detection Platform Infrastructure role combines my detection engineering background with platform development. I understand that this position emphasizes software engineering for security infrastructure rather than traditional security operations. My experience architecting log pipelines and building security tooling in Python provides a foundation, though I recognize I would be growing into the data engineering and ML aspects of the role.

I am based in Cyprus and open to relocating to San Francisco. I would require visa sponsorship.

Sincerely,
Aleksandr Liukov
