- **Rationale:** Exact match to position title; profile supports this at Lead/Senior level

### Profile Summary
- **Approach:** Lead with years of experience and product security specialization
- **Included:** SSDLC integration, security tooling development, AI-driven tools, OSCP/CISSP credentials
- **Rationale:** Emphasizes user's focus (product security) and Anthropic's AI relevance

### Work Experience

| Company | Role | Bullets | Rationale |
|---------|------|---------|-----------|
| Unlimit | Lead Product Security Engineer | 6 | Current role, highly relevant, product security focus |
| Kaspersky Lab | Information Security Architect | 5 | Direct design review, SSDLC, architecture work |

| Positive Technologies | System Integration Specialist | 2 | Attack simulations show offensive mindset |
| GDC (Fujitsu) | Security/IT Engineer | 1 | Consolidated; shows career progression foundation |

**Omitted:**
- Atos (Service Desk/System Admin) - too far back, infrastructure-focused
- Detailed SCCM/WSUS work - not relevant to application security

### Skills Organization

| Category | Contents | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Application Security | SSDLC, threat modeling, SAST/SCA/DAST, Burp, ZAP, DefectDojo | Primary JD focus |
| Security Architecture | Defense-in-depth, zero-trust, STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK | Design reviews emphasized |
| Vulnerability Management | Tools, prioritization, workflows | Explicit JD responsibility |
| Automation & Development | Python, Bash, IaC, AI tools | Tooling development emphasized |
| Cloud & Container Security | K8s tools, Docker, AWS, CI/CD | Required in JD |
| Security Operations | SIEM, correlation, investigation | Shows breadth |

**De-emphasized:**
- PowerShell, Active Directory, Azure - less relevant to this role
- SCCM/WSUS, infrastructure admin - too far from AppSec

### Certifications

2. **OSCP (2020)** - Demonstrates offensive security capability
3. **Splunk Certified User (2018)** - Supports monitoring/operations background

1. Opening: Position applied for, years of experience, core focus
2. Body 1: Vulnerability management program, security pipeline integration, Product Security Requirements
3. Body 2: OSCP/offensive capability, AI-driven tools, cross-functional advisory
4. Closing: Interest in AI security challenges, relocation readiness

## 6. Motivation Letter

**Generated:** ✅ Yes (company research available)

**Themes:**
1. Personal experience building AI-driven security tools
2. Alignment with Anthropic's "secure by default, private by design" philosophy
3. Interest in novel AI security challenges (prompt injection, data poisoning, model extraction)
4. Understanding of Responsible Scaling Policy and ASL framework
5. Experience scaling security practices in growing organizations

**Avoided:**
- Generic statements about "changing the world"
- Parroting company values back at them
- Flowery or marketing-style language

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Strengths to Emphasize in Interview
1. **Vulnerability management program building** - DefectDojo, automation, prioritization logic
2. **Security pipeline integration** - SAST/SCA/DAST into CI/CD with developer experience focus
3. **AI-driven security tools** - Direct relevance to Anthropic's work
4. **Offensive security capability** - OSCP, pen testing experience
5. **Cross-functional collaboration** - Advisory role with product teams

### Gaps to Address
1. **Bug bounty program experience** - No direct program management; emphasize internal pen testing, vulnerability coordination, root cause analysis as transferable skills
2. **AI/ML specific security risks** - Limited explicit experience; express genuine interest and learning trajectory
3. **GCP experience** - Only AWS; emphasize multi-cloud transferability

### Interview Preparation Suggestions
1. Research AI/ML security risks: prompt injection, jailbreaking, data poisoning, model extraction
2. Review Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy and ASL framework
3. Prepare examples of "non-blocking" security - enabling developers, not gatekeeping
4. Be ready to discuss how to build security tooling at scale
5. Think through how traditional AppSec frameworks apply (or don't) to AI products
