Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Application Security Engineer position at Anthropic. With 11 years of experience in security engineering—the last several focused on product security and secure SDLC—I have built vulnerability management programs, integrated security tooling into CI/CD pipelines, and worked closely with engineering teams to embed security into the development lifecycle.

In my current role at Unlimit, I developed the company-wide Product Security Requirements standard and engineered an integrated vulnerability management system using DefectDojo with custom Python automation. I architected and deployed enterprise security pipelines that integrate SAST, SCA, and secrets scanning directly into CI/CD workflows, with automated findings ingestion and developer-facing dashboards. I also developed AI-driven tools to examine codebases for business logic vulnerabilities and automate triage of scanner findings—work that has given me practical experience applying AI to security challenges.

My OSCP certification reflects hands-on offensive security capability: I conduct penetration testing of web applications, APIs, and infrastructure, and have identified critical vulnerabilities in both internal products and third-party vendor software. My CISSP provides the breadth to connect security concerns across domains. At Kaspersky Lab, I defined secure architecture principles, implemented SSDLC processes, and advised engineering teams on threat modeling and secure design.

I am drawn to Anthropic's position at the frontier of AI safety and the opportunity to help secure AI products that are pushing established security boundaries. I am prepared to relocate to the United States and can work in your offices as required. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building security programs and tooling can contribute to your Application Security team.

Sincerely,
Aleksandr Liukov
