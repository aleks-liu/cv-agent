Dear Hiring Team,

Building security for AI systems that might shape humanity's future requires a different kind of thinking—security that enables rather than blocks, scales with engineering velocity, and treats every control as a product decision. This is why the Senior Software Security Engineer role at Anthropic resonates deeply with my approach to security engineering.

Over 11 years, I've built security infrastructure across fast-moving organizations: hardening Kubernetes clusters with policy enforcement (Kyverno, Falco), securing CI/CD pipelines against supply chain risks, and deploying security controls through Infrastructure as Code. At TheSoul Publishing, I strengthened container security and pipeline hardening for a company running massive media infrastructure. Currently at Unlimit, I lead security engineering for a fintech platform, building automated vulnerability management systems and integrating security directly into developer workflows.

What draws me to Anthropic specifically is your articulation that security should be "non-blocking" and "secure by default with minimal friction." This matches how I've approached every security program I've built—automation over gates, empowering developers with secure defaults rather than fighting them with processes. I've also begun developing AI-powered security tools myself, using LLMs for vulnerability triage and code analysis, which has deepened my appreciation for the unique security challenges frontier AI systems present.

I'm ready to bring my experience in large-scale infrastructure security to help protect AI systems that genuinely matter. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with your team's needs.

Sincerely,
Aleksandr Liukov
