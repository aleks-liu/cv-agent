Dear Hiring Manager,

When I learned that Anthropic replaced their traditional SOC with an AI-powered operation built entirely on Claude, something clicked. Security doesn't have to mean friction — it can mean intelligence, speed, and scale. That philosophy aligns precisely with how I approach security engineering.

For the past 11 years, I've been building security into systems rather than bolting it on afterward. At TheSoul Publishing, I hardened Kubernetes clusters with Kyverno and Falco, automated security controls through Terraform and Ansible, and secured CI/CD pipelines at scale. Currently at Unlimit, I architect enterprise security pipelines integrating SAST, SCA, and secrets scanning into developer workflows — designed to enable engineering velocity, not impede it. I've deployed container security policies, built vulnerability management systems, and consistently worked to make security the path of least resistance.

What draws me to Anthropic isn't just the technical challenge of securing large-scale AI infrastructure. It's the recognition that getting security right at the frontier matters enormously. I already use Claude Code daily to build AI-driven tools that analyze codebases for vulnerabilities and automate security triage. The opportunity to secure the systems that make such tools possible — and to contribute to a team that treats security as enabling rather than blocking — feels like the right next step.

I would welcome the chance to discuss how my experience with cloud security architecture, Kubernetes hardening, and automation-first security practices could contribute to Anthropic's mission.

Sincerely,
Aleksandr Liukov
