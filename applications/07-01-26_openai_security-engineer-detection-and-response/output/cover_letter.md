Dear Hiring Manager,

When I built my first SIEM correlation query that caught an actual intrusion attempt buried in millions of log events, I understood that detection engineering is where raw data becomes meaningful defense. Now, at a moment when AI systems are reshaping what's possible in security, I'm drawn to OpenAI's Security team—where the technology being protected is itself transforming how we protect everything else.

My experience aligns directly with your Detection & Response focus. At VKontakte, I constructed monitoring infrastructure from scratch: deploying collection agents across thousands of endpoints, configuring Splunk and Humio pipelines, and developing detection rules that transformed high-volume telemetry into actionable alerts. The work wasn't just technical—it was about building systems that could scale with an organization while maintaining signal clarity. I've carried that automation-first philosophy through every role since.

What makes this opportunity distinct is the intersection with AI. At Unlimit, I've been developing LLM-powered tools that examine codebases for business logic flaws and automate findings triage—work that mirrors OpenAI's vision of using AI to strengthen security posture. Combined with my Azure certification, SIEM expertise across multiple platforms, and OSCP-backed offensive perspective, I bring the generalist toolkit your team values.

I'm ready to relocate to Sydney and contribute to a team that's building security for technology that will shape decades to come.

Sincerely,
Aleksandr Liukov
