## Special Notes for Fellowship Application

This application package was tailored specifically for the **Anthropic AI Security Fellowship**, not a regular employment position. Key adaptations:

1. **Research orientation** — CV framed toward research potential rather than operational excellence
2. **Python emphasis** — explicitly required, placed prominently
3. **AI safety motivation** — central theme in cover letter and motivation letter
4. **Fellow project awareness** — referenced SCONE-bench and SHADE-Arena to show understanding of expected outputs
5. **Relocation commitment** — explicitly stated willingness for Berkeley or London
6. **Public output focus** — acknowledged fellowship expectation of published research

The candidate's primary value proposition is bringing **security practitioner depth** to AI safety research — a perspective that may be underrepresented among typical applicants who come from ML/AI backgrounds.
