## 4. CV Decisions

### Profile Summary
**Approach:** Tailored for fintech security context, emphasizing:
- Current fintech payments experience (Unlimit)
- "Building security into fast-moving engineering cultures" (Revolut resonance)
- "Automation-first security that scales with business growth" (matches their growth trajectory)
- Both strategic and tactical capabilities

**Summary Used:**
> Security engineer with 11 years of experience, currently leading product security at a fintech payments company. Specializes in building security into fast-moving engineering cultures — from vulnerability management systems and security pipelines to threat modeling and penetration testing. Foundation in infrastructure and system administration combined with development skills enables bridging security requirements with engineering execution. Advocate for automation-first security that scales with business growth. OSCP and CISSP certified.

### Skills Organization
| Category | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Security Engineering** | Broad foundation, product security focus |
| **Application Security** | Core AppSec tools and methodologies |
| **Automation & Development** | Shows engineering capability (Revolut values) |
| **Cloud & Containers** | Matches Kubernetes/cloud stack |
| **Cryptography & Identity** | Critical for banking/fintech |
| **Security Operations** | Shows monitoring/detection breadth |

### Employment Emphasis

| Company | Bullets | Rationale |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Unlimit** | 7 | Current, fintech, HSM/payments — most relevant |
| **Kaspersky** | 5 | Security vendor credibility, architecture role |
| **TheSoul Publishing** | 4 | DevSecOps, Kubernetes — engineering alignment |
| **VKontakte** | 5 | Scale (large consumer platform), SIEM expertise |
| **Positive Technologies** | 3 | Security product experience, automation |
| **GDC (Fujitsu)** | 2 | Condensed, identity/infrastructure foundation |
| **Atos** | 1 | Early career, minimal space |

### Key Highlights Included
- HSM administration and cryptographic key migration (banking-critical)
- Found critical vulnerabilities in third-party banking software
- AI-driven security tooling development (innovation)
- Enterprise-wide security pipeline architecture
- VKontakte scale monitoring infrastructure

### Deliberately Omitted/Minimized
- Detailed early career (pre-2018) — shows progression but doesn't add value
- Security awareness campaigns — less relevant for engineering-focused org
- Azure certification — AWS/Kubernetes more relevant to their GCP stack

## 5. Message Approach

### Previous Message Analysis
**Strengths:**
- Concise, respectful
- Clear about experience level
- Mentions relocation readiness

**Improvements Made:**
| Previous | New |
|----------|-----|
| "Hope you don't mind the cold message!" | "I'm reaching out directly because Revolut has been on my mind" |
| Generic background list | Specific fintech context ("payments fintech", "security pipelines") |
| "Keep growing into senior leadership" | "Security that enables rather than blocks" |
| "Happy to chat if useful" (passive) | Specific ask (CV or conversation) |
| No company-specific reason | Clear why Revolut ("reshaping how millions interact with money") |

### Message Alignment with Revolut Values
- **Never Settle:** Shows ambition to join world-class fintech
- **Think Deeper:** Specific about security philosophy, not generic
- **Get It Done:** Direct ask, respects her time
- **Deliver WOW:** Focuses on enabling value, not blocking

### Two Versions Provided
1. **Full version (~750 chars):** More context, storytelling, relationship-building
2. **Short version (~450 chars):** Punchy, efficient, for LinkedIn character limits

## 6. Risks & Considerations

### Potential Concerns
| Issue | Mitigation |
|-------|------------|
| No specific role application | Message explicitly acknowledges exploring fit |
| Russian work history | Cyprus-based now, mentions relocation readiness |
| Apollinaria is Java recruiter | Security likely separate team, she may redirect |
| No public security roles posted | Expression of interest approach is appropriate |

### Interview Preparation Notes
If Apollinaria responds positively, be prepared to discuss:
1. Specific challenges of fintech security at scale
2. How security enables velocity vs. blocking
3. Experience with fast-moving product teams
4. Automation philosophy and examples
5. Why Revolut specifically (research on their tech blog, products)
