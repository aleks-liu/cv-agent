Hi Apollinaria,

I'm a security engineer, 11 years experience. Currently leading product security at Unlimit (payments fintech) in Cyprus.

I'm writing because I'm interested in Revolut. Not applying to a specific role — just exploring if there's a fit.

Why Revolut? I like the product — I use it myself. And I respect how you build things: high standards, proper engineering. I value the same approach in my work and would like to be part of a team that shares it.

What I do: vulnerability management, security automation, penetration testing, working with dev teams on secure architecture. I like building systems, digging into internal mechanics, not just reviewing tickets or performing repeating tasks.

I checked your careers page — no security roles that fit right now. But if something is coming up or there are unlisted positions, happy to share my CV or just talk.

Thanks,
Aleksandr
