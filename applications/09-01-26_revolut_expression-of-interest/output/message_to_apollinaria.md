Hi Apollinaria,

I'm reaching out directly because Revolut has been on my mind as the place where I want to take my security career next.

Quick context: I'm a security engineer with 11 years in the field, currently leading product security at Unlimit — a payments fintech in Cyprus. I already live the tension between moving fast and staying secure that defines fintech. My days involve building vulnerability management systems, securing payment flows, and making security work with engineering velocity rather than against it.

What draws me to Revolut specifically: you're reshaping how millions interact with money, and that scale of impact requires security thinking that goes beyond checkbox compliance. I've spent years building security that enables rather than blocks — from threat modeling and penetration testing to automating security pipelines that developers actually want to use. The ownership mindset Revolut values is how I've always approached security work.

I'm not applying to a specific role today — I'm exploring whether there's a fit somewhere in your security org. Happy to share my CV or just have a conversation about what security challenges look like at Revolut's scale.

Thanks for reading this far.

## Alternative Shorter Version (~450 characters)

Hi Apollinaria,

I'm a product security engineer at a payments fintech (Unlimit, Cyprus), 11 years in security, OSCP/CISSP certified. Revolut's scale and engineering culture is exactly where I want to take my career next.

I build security that enables velocity — vulnerability management systems, security pipelines, threat modeling — the kind of ownership-driven work that fits Revolut's mindset.

Would love to explore if there's a fit somewhere in your security org. Happy to share more or just connect.

## Notes on Message Strategy

**Why this approach:**
- Opens with intention, not apology ("reaching out because" vs "hope you don't mind")
- Immediately establishes relevant context (fintech security, Cyprus-based)
- Shows understanding of Revolut's challenge ("tension between fast and secure")
- Uses Revolut language naturally ("ownership mindset", "enables rather than blocks")
- Specific about what he does, not generic ("payments flows", "security pipelines")
- Respects her time with concrete ask (CV or conversation)
- Doesn't name-drop her articles (would feel forced)

**Alignment with Apollinaria's values (from her articles):**
- Shows clear career direction (she warns against uncertainty)
- Focuses on what he wants to achieve, not what he's escaping
- Treats her as a career partner, not a gatekeeper
- Is specific about strengths without overselling
- Demonstrates proactivity and preparation
