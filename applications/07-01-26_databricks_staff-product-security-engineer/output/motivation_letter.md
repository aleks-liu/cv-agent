# Why I Want to Join Databricks

When I saw that Databricks' CSO Fermin Serna came from leading Product Security at Google, I knew this wasn't a company that treats security as a compliance checkbox. Building the Data Intelligence Platform that powers AI applications for enterprises like Palo Alto Networks and Arctic Wolf requires security that scales—and that's the kind of engineering challenge I've spent my career preparing for.

## Alignment with Mission

Databricks' mission to democratize data and AI resonates with how I approach security work. The goal isn't to slow engineering down; it's to enable them to ship faster with confidence. When Ali Ghodsi says "it's actually the governance of the data that's the problem" for enterprise AI adoption, I hear a company that understands security as a strategic capability, not overhead.

My work building integrated vulnerability management systems and embedding security pipelines into CI/CD reflects this same philosophy. Left-shifting security isn't about adding gates—it's about giving developers the tools and feedback loops to build secure code from the start.

## What Excites Me About Databricks Today

The recent launch of Agent Bricks and Lakebase represents exactly the kind of technical frontier where product security becomes critical. When over 80% of databases on your platform are being launched by AI agents rather than humans, the threat model fundamentally changes. The Databricks AI Security Framework (DASF) identifying 55 technical security risks across AI/ML components shows the team is already thinking about these problems systematically.

I'm particularly drawn to the challenge of securing systems where the boundaries between data platform, AI models, and autonomous agents blur. This is new territory that requires first-principles thinking rather than applying conventional security playbooks.

## What I Bring

Beyond the technical match with the role requirements, I offer the automation-first mindset that Databricks culture values. Every security control I've built prioritizes making the secure path the easy path. I've developed AI-assisted tooling for code analysis, built Python automation for vulnerability triage, and designed systems that scale without requiring security team intervention on every decision.

The bias-for-action principle aligns with how I work. I'd rather ship an 80% solution this week than a perfect one next quarter, then iterate based on real feedback.

## Looking Forward

Databricks is at a fascinating inflection point—$134B valuation, explosive growth in AI products, and security customers processing trillions of events through the platform. Contributing to product security for systems at this scale, protecting customer data while enabling innovation, is exactly the challenge I'm looking for.

I'm excited about the possibility of becoming a Brickster.
