**Key Elements Included:**
- 11 years experience
- Product security and secure SDLC specialization
- SAST, SCA, DAST pipeline architecture
- Security design reviews and threat modeling
- OSCP certification for offensive/exploit credibility
- Python automation emphasis
- **"Enabling engineering teams to ship faster"** — aligns with Customer Obsessed value
- **"Risk-based prioritization"** — exact JD language, aligns with company's practical approach
- **"Scalable security operations"** — aligns with Bias for Action at scale

### Employment Prioritization

| Company | Bullets | Rationale |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Unlimit (current) | 6 | Most relevant - direct SDLC/product security match |
| Kaspersky | 4 | Strong architecture and design review experience |
| TheSoul | 3 | SAST/DAST automation, Kubernetes security |
| VKontakte | 3 | SIEM and Python automation |
| Positive Technologies | 2 | **Critical for exploit writing** - attack simulations |
| GDC (Fujitsu) | 2 | Older but shows identity/alert investigation |
| Atos | 1 | Oldest, foundation only |

### Skills Categories
Organized to lead with JD-required skills:
1. Application Security & SDLC (direct match)
2. Security Architecture & Design (threat modeling)
3. Vulnerability Management (SAST false positive work)
4. Programming & Automation (Python emphasis)
5. Cloud & Container Security (Kubernetes, CI/CD)
6. Security Operations (SIEM for IR support)

### Certifications Selected
- **OSCP (2020)** — Critical for exploit writing requirement
- **CISSP (2022)** — Validates senior security expertise

MCSE was excluded to maintain focus on security relevance.

### Excluded/Minimized
- Go (learning phase, not relevant)
- Heavy infrastructure details from early career
- MCSE certification (less relevant)

## 7. Recommendations

### Interview Preparation

**Be Ready to Discuss:**
1. Specific threat modeling methodologies (STRIDE, data flow diagrams)
2. SAST/DAST tool experience and false positive reduction strategies
3. Exploit development examples from OSCP or Positive Technologies work
4. How you've embedded security into SDLC without slowing engineering
5. Python automation examples for security workflows
6. Risk-based prioritization decisions

**Potential Gap Questions:**
