Dear Hiring Manager,

The Product Security team at Databricks caught my attention because of its mission to left-shift security across the entire SDLC. This is precisely the work I've been doing for the past several years, and I'd like to bring that experience to a company building the Data Intelligence Platform that over half the Fortune 500 relies on.

Currently at Unlimit, I architect and maintain enterprise security pipelines that integrate SAST, SCA, and secrets scanning directly into CI/CD workflows. I perform security design reviews and threat modeling for product features, working as a security SME throughout the development lifecycle. My work on automated vulnerability management systems—consolidating scanner findings, automating triage, and reducing false positives—directly maps to what your team does with SAST and DAST tools at scale.

Beyond process engineering, I bring hands-on offensive skills. I'm OSCP certified and have developed automated attack simulations and exploit scripts to validate detection capabilities. At Kaspersky, I evaluated product designs to identify security flaws and guided engineering teams on embedding security into their architecture decisions.

What resonates most about Databricks is the truth-seeking culture and first-principles approach. Security work demands both—cutting through assumptions to find actual risk, then engineering practical controls rather than checkbox compliance. The fact that Databricks treats data governance as the critical bottleneck for enterprise AI tells me security is valued as an enabler here, not a gate.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to the Product Security team's mission.

Sincerely,
Aleksandr Liukov
